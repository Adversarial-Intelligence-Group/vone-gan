# VOneNet: CNNs with a Primary Visual Cortex Front-End

A family of biologically-inspired Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). VOneNets have the following features:
- Fixed-weight neural network model of the primate primary visual cortex (V1) as the front-end.
- Robust to image perturbations
- Brain-mapped
- Flexible: can be adapted to different back-end architectures

1. You need to clone it in your local repository
  $ git clone https://github.com/ASPIR141/vonenet.git
2. Install dependencies using pipenv
3. Run the code
  $ python3 run.py
