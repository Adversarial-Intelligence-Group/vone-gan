# VOneNet-GAN: GANs with a Primary Visual Cortex Front-End

Biologically-inspired Generative Neural Networks (GANs). VOneNets have the following features:
- Fixed-weight neural network model of the primate primary visual cortex (V1) as the front-end.
- Robust to image perturbations
- Brain-mapped
- Flexible: can be adapted to different Discriminator architectures

## Setup and Run
1. You need to clone it in your local repository
  $ git clone https://github.com/Adversarial-Intelligence-Group/vone-gan.git
2. Install dependencies using pipenv
3. Run the code
  $ python3 train.py
