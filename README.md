# VOneNet-GAN: GANs with a Primary Visual Cortex Front-End

Biologically-inspired Generative Neural Networks (GANs). VOneNets have the following features:
- Fixed-weight neural network model of the primate primary visual cortex (V1) as the front-end
- Robust to image perturbations
- Brain-mapped
- Flexible: can be adapted to different Discriminator architectures

## Setup and Run
1. You need to clone it in your local repository
  `$ git clone https://github.com/Adversarial-Intelligence-Group/vone-gan.git`
3. Install dependencies using pipenv
4. Run the code
  `$ python3 train.py`
